# Creating a Blockchain with Python

**Delve into the foundational technology behind cryptocurrencies as we build a blockchain from scratch using Python.**

**Please note:** The notebook is written in Spanish.

## Overview

This project takes you through the process of creating a basic blockchain. It covers setting up your Python environment, defining the blockchain class, mining blocks, and running a simple Flask app to simulate interactions with your blockchain.

## What's Inside?

1. **Adjustments**: Prepare the environment with all necessary installations and libraries.
2. **Class**: Define a `Blockchain` class with all essential methods like creating a new block, validating the chain, and more.
3. **Mining a Block**: Learn how to mine a new block and add it to the chain.
4. **Running the App**: See the blockchain in action with a simple web app.

## How It's Done

- **Settings**: We begin by setting up the stage with the right Python libraries and dependencies.
- **Blockchain Class**: Dive into coding a `Blockchain` class that encapsulates the blockchain's functionality.
- **Mining**: Understand the concept of mining and how to implement the Proof of Work algorithm to add new blocks.
- **Execution**: Wrap up by executing a basic Flask application to interact with the blockchain in real-time.
